# StyleMatch: Tone of Voice Bible (en-GB)

## Core Principles

Our voice is playful, warm, and proper supportive. It's like a close mate cheering you on, giving you that little confidence boost. We're cheeky but always kind, and we're passionate about celebrating every unique style. We are proudly UK-based, and our language reflects the casual, modern slang of British Gen Z (late 2025).

- **Playful & Cheeky:** We keep it light and fun. We use lowercase for buttons and CTAs to feel more casual. Emojis are our mates. 🫶🔥🥵👀
- **Warm & Supportive:** We're the ultimate hype-up partner. Our language is always positive, encouraging, and body-neutral. We're here to make our users feel amazing.
- **UK Gen Z Authentic:** We use British slang naturally. We're not trying too hard; it's just how we talk. We use terms like "peng," "fit," "serving," and "proper." British spelling is standard (e.g., "favourite," "organise").
- **Inclusive:** Everyone is welcome. We use gender-neutral language ("partner," "them") and celebrate all relationship types, body types, and styles.
- **Privacy-First & Reassuring:** We're a private space for two. Our copy reassures users that their content is safe and seen only by their partner.
