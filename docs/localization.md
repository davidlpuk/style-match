## Core Principles for Localisation

-   **Maintain the Vibe:** The core tone is playful, supportive, and positive. This should be retained even if specific slang is changed.
-   **Emoji Use:** Emojis are a key part of the brand voice. Localise them thoughtfully, ensuring they resonate with the target culture.
-   **Consult Local Gen Z:** When moving into a new region, work with local Gen Z speakers to find equivalent slang that feels authentic, not forced.

## UK Slang & Global Alternatives

This table flags specific British slang terms and suggests more globally understood alternatives for easier localisation.

| UK Slang (en-GB)      | Meaning                                       | Global Alternative (en-US Example) | Notes                                                                   |

| **Peng**              | Very attractive, stylish, excellent           | "Amazing," "Incredible," "Fire"    | "Peng" is heavily UK-specific. "Fire" is a good, widely understood alternative. |
| **Fit**               | An outfit (noun); attractive (adjective)      | "Outfit," "Look"; "Hot," "Cute"    | The dual meaning can be tricky. Use context to determine the best alternative. |
| **Serving**           | Nailing a look, looking incredible            | "Slaying," "Killing it," "Nailed it" | "Slaying" is a very common and safe global alternative.                 |
| **Ate that**          | Did something exceptionally well, nailed it   | "Nailed it," "Killed it," "Slayed"   | This is gaining traction globally but might not be universally known.   |
| **Proper**            | Very, really                                  | "So," "Really," "Totally"          | A very British adverb. Easy to replace.                                 |
| **Dead** (as in "dead private") | Totally, completely, very             | "Totally," "Super," "Completely"   | A common UK colloquialism.                                              |
| **Mate**              | Friend                                        | "Friend," "Buddy" (or omit)        | Often, this can be removed without losing meaning in the sentence.      |
| **Cheeky**            | Playfully mischievous                         | "Playful," "A little fun"          | Has a specific cultural nuance in the UK.                               |
| **Buzzing**           | Very excited, happy                           | "So excited," "Hyped"              |                                                                         |
| **Go on**             | A form of encouragement, like "go for it"     | "Go for it," "You got this"        |                                                                         |
| **Sweet**             | Cool, okay, understood                        | "Got it," "Cool," "Okay"           |                                                                         |
| **Alright?**          | A common greeting, "how are you?"             | "What's up?," "Hey"                | A very common British greeting.                                         |

### Example Localisation

**en-GB Master:**
> "This fit is proper peng 🔥"

**en-US Translation:**
> "That outfit is totally fire 🔥"

**Notes:**
-   "fit" -> "outfit"
-   "proper" -> "totally"
-   "peng" -> "fire"

By documenting these nuances, we can ensure that as StyleMatch grows, its voice feels just as authentic in new markets as it does in the UK.
